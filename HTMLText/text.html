    <h1> Welcome to my web page </h1>

    <h4> (Lets learn HTML!) </h4>

    <p> Before we start let me tell you a little about myself.
    This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time that I have taught this course.
    I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and grace until
    now. Of course, I hope to continue to grow in both wisodom and grace but
    that will require effort and attention to what is happening in the world
    and in myself. I hope you learn a lot about web programming and are
    enlightened by what we do in the class. Good luck!</p>

    When writing web pages you need to make sure you are attentive to lots of
    details like the structure and formatting of the page. I want to
    <strong> emphasize </strong> to you the importance of this.

    I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to
    quote myself.
    <blockquote> It is very important to be aware of all the small
    details when writing web pages. Afterall, small details can make a big
    differenece. Be concious of what you are learning and why you are learning
    it. We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we must always exert
    effort to learn</blockquote>
