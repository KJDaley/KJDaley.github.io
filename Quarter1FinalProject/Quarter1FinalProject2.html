           <li> It is my favorite game in the Super Smash Bros series. Its mechanics
           and huge range of gaming options make it the most solid and best entry
           so far. </li>
           <li> Before it was released, I really enjoyed keeping up with the latest
           updates and news, spending most of my days anxious to see what was going
           to be revealed next. </li>
           <li> There is a club at SLUH based around it that I attend every Friday,
           and I've created a solid group of friends from that club. </li>

           <li> Splatoon 2 was the first game on the Nintendo Switch, other than
           Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, that I was able to get really passionate about. </li>
           <li> It has a vareity of gamemodes, each of them being really addictive
           in their own way. </li>
           <li> It's heavy focus on multiplayer has always been my favorite aspect,
           as I enjoy getting to go against or work with other players, helping
         me understand where I am in terms of skill. </li>
           <li> I prefer this game over the first game because of it's more expansive
           game variety, including better singleplayer and more immersive matches. </li>

           Sunshine. It is one of the first games I was able to complete 100%.</li>
           <li> It includes very fun and memorable levels, and the gameplay
           mechanics, even the motion control ones, don't get annoying. </li>
           <li> It includes a very intriging story, based around one of the characters
           in the game. It's a really tragic and beautiful tale. </li>
           <li> I felt the original was better than the sequal due to it having

           <li> It's really easy to pick up, with a simple character roster, simple
           tracks to race on, and simple modes to play.</li>
           <li> The singleplayer races have an added level of diffuctly due to the

           <li> It has very memorable stages, characters, and minigames. In fact,
           the minigames were so memeorable that I can't help but constantly compare
         all Mario Party games with the ones offered in 6. </li>
           <li> My sister and I would often play this together, sparking my first
