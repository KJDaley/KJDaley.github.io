            CowCraft was the first Minecraft server that I regular played on. It
            wasn't a bad community, but it was starting to die down when I really
            started getting into it. I have fond memories from this time, lots
            of fun projects, funny moments with friends, and some really engaging
            conversations. Though a lot of the people I met here I no longer
            communicate with, due to problems that have occured, I did enjoy
            the time I had spent here.

              BlockBit stated of as a replacement for the CowCraft community I had
              lost, but it quickly became something more. I pulled the people from
              my old communities, along with new people I met along the way, into
              a new group, one that would be much more friendly to everyone. We
              played Minecraft, Team Fortress 2, and many other games together,
              as well as discuss a variety of topics. I still do regularly chat
              with them.

              Super Smash Bros Club is a student-run club here at SLUH, where fans
              of the series come together to play each other. When I first heard
              of the club in Freshman year, I was skeptical of joining, but after
              discussing with my counsler about my inablity to communicate, she
              suggested this club as a way to open myself up. As the self-proclaimed
              third-in-command of the club, I do enjoy myself here. We continue
              to grow and expand as a club.
