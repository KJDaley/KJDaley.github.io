      <p class="welp"> I have had two Youtube channels is my life. The first one
      was called SuperKirby111, and I posted very poorly made videos about Super
    Smash Bros news, Minecraft Pocket Edition builds, and opinions on topics related
  to gaming. When I stated my new channel, known as Kindoe at the time, I had better
material and better skills, and was able to make better videos on the games I played.
I continued the gaming trend throughout the channel's lifetime, including when we
were named Relo Productions, and then currently, Relo Entertainment. Nowadays, we
haven't been doing as many gaming based videos, but the lasting impact video games
have had on the channel, and on me, cannot be ignored.</p>
