      LJ is one of my best friends. We have been friends since 7th grade. We attended Loyala Academy of
      Saint Louis together from 7th grade to 8th grade. I didn't go there 6th grade year, but even so, him and I became
      good friends, along with another person named DJ. The three of us have come up with many inside jokes, one of which
      is based on a moment our class went to camp and one of the teachers talked about how much he wanted a piece of fried chicken.
      One day this year, I dedcided to put LJ's face on a piece of chicken.
