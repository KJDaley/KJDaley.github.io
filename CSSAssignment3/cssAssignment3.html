        <p> If I could visit any place, real or fictional, it would have to be
        these six places. Japan's Akihabara is known as otaku central, and as a fan of
        anime, I have a big desire to visit this place at least once. It has a
        really cool shopping district, maid cafes, and other fun things. I would
        also like to visit Jamaica, where my Dad's side of the family comes from,
        and Hawaii. Both places have a beautifal landscape and wonderful beaches,
        which I  haven't really gotten a chance to fully experience in my life.
        Super Nintendo World is a future location coming in 2020 located in Japan.
        It is a theme park based on Nintendo's most famous IPs. I really love Nintendo,
        so this place is calling for me to visit it in the future. Shrek's swamp is
        the home of one of my favorite animated characters, and has many interesting
        attractions like mud baths and other swamp activites. I can't say I'm a
        huge fan of wetlands, but if I could see Shrek, I'm good. Finally, the
        Mushroom Kingdom, the place where my favorite video game franchise of
        all time takes place in nearly all games. It has many fun activites I
        would like to try, like jumping on mushrooms, racing "karts", and using
        powers. These six places seem really awesome, and I hope I can visit them.
