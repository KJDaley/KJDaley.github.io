      <p class="infotext"> I love video games a lot. Gaming is my favorite hobby,
        and it's been a very significant part of my life, ever since I got to play
        my first game ever, Mario Kart 64, on the Nintendo 64. Ever since, I've
        played a variety of different games across multiple consoles, but my
        enjoyment has remained the same no matter what I play. This website is
        intented to display that enjoyment with my most enjoyable hobby, by showing
        off my favorite video games, the gaming communities I've intergrated
        myself into over the years, and the presence I've created for myself
        through the internet as a video creator as a YouTuber.
